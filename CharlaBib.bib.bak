  Abstract                 = {In order to analyze theoretically the dynamics of
osteoblast and osteoclast cells in the bone remodeling process we first consider
a simplified Komarova model. The existence of periodic solutions, which is
consistent with the biophysical phenomenon, has been observed only numerically
for the general model. By a stability analysis of the simplified model we
provide sufficient conditions to obtain existence and uniqueness of positive
periodic solutions. Considering recent biological evidence about the
participation of another cells like osteocytes in the regulation of bone
remodeling, we incorporate to the simplified model a new term as a way to model
the signaling of external agents in the remodeling process. Finally, we
demonstrate that this new model has stable positive non-periodic solutions. All
the theoretical results are accompanied by computational simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A recurrent problem in ecology and conservation
biology is to estimate the risk of population extinctions. Extinction
probabilities are not only imperative for conservation and management, but may
also elucidate basic mechanisms of the regulation of natural populations
(Burgman et al. 1993; Pimm 1994). The usual way of modelling stochastic
influence on population dynamics has been to assume that the external noise is
uncorrelated. This means that each and every randomly drawn noise value is
totally independent on previous ones. This is what is generally called `white'
noise. However, the noise itself can be temporally autocorrelated. That is, the
values of the random numbers used in the noise process will depend on previous
ones. Here we show that the autocorrelation, or colour, of the external noise
assumed to influence population dynamics strongly modifies estimated extinction
probabilities. For positively autocorrelated (`red') noise, the risk of
extinction clearly decreases the stronger the autocorrelation is. Negatively
autocorrelated (`blue') noise is more ambiguously related to extinction
probability. Thus, the commonly assumed white noise in population modelling will
severely bias population extinction risk estimates. Moreover, the extinction
probability estimates are also significantly dependent on model structure which
calls for a cautious use of traditional discrete-time models.},

applied in conjunction with the deterministic model to give additional

abstract = {Physiological bone remodeling is a highly coordinated process 
responsible for bone resorption and formation and is necessary to repair damaged 
bone and to maintain mineral homeostasis. In addition to the traditional bone 
cells (osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes) that are necessary for bone 
remodeling, several immune cells have also been implicated in bone disease. This 
mini-review discusses physiological bone remodeling, outlining the tra-ditional 
bone biology dogma in light of emerging osteoimmunol-ogy data. Specifically 
discussed in detail are the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone 
remodeling, including events that orchestrate the five sequential phases of bone 
remodeling: activa-tion, resorption, reversal, formation, and termination. Bone 
is a dynamic tissue that undergoes continual adaption during vertebrate life to 
attain and preserve skeletal size, shape, and structural integrity and to 
regulate mineral homeostasis. Two processes, remodeling and modeling, underpin 
develop-ment and maintenance of the skeletal system. Bone modeling is 
responsible for growth and mechanically induced adaption of bone and requires 
that the processes of bone formation and bone removal (resorption), although 
globally coordinated, occur independently at distinct anatomical locations. Bone 
remodeling is responsible for removal and repair of damaged bone to maintain 
integrity of the adult skeleton and mineral homeostasis. This tightly 
coordinated event requires the syn-chronized activities of multiple cellular 
participants to ensure that bone resorption and formation occur sequentially at 
the same anatomical location to preserve bone mass. This work will review the 
cellular participants and molecular mechanisms that coordinate the five distinct 
phases of bone remodeling and includes an appraisal of immune cells and their 
role in regulat-ing normal bone physiology.},
